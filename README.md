# SHOEDAYS Demo App
My first project created with Strapi and React integration only for the "Strapi React case study" demonstration purposes, meaning this app is not fully developed or designed. This project represents my first attempt at creating a REST API and developing an app in React. Consequently, the code snippets and descriptions provided may not adhere to best practices and could contain inaccuracies.

### Run project folders
- Backend > Strapi Quickstart > npm run develop
- Frontend > React > npm run start


The Strapi-React case study covers:

- The integration of Strapi with React to create a RESTful API and frontend interface for displaying product information.
- A detailed step-by-step instruction with code snippets as screenshots and explanations for setting up the backend and frontend, fetching data, and deploying the application.
- In this case study, I showcase the utilization of my app called "Shoedays," purpose-built for this demonstration. This app serves only as a practical demonstration of backend and frontend integration using Strapi - and React over design.
- The case study file is located in the src/content/docs/frameworks/react
